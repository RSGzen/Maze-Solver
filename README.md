MAZE SOLVER APPLICATION

Hi, I am very glad that you are here to support our small developing application.
Thank you for all the support and tolerance given to us.

This is a application made for use of the public to educate and learn about search algorithms.
I hope that the integration of learning search algorithms into a small visual game would help.

How to download:
    You would need to download three things for it to run:
    - assets
    - scripts
    - main.exe

To start the game:
    You need to run the:
    - main.exe

Then, there would be a guide on the main menu that will guide you through the whole app.

Hope you enjoy our game!!!
Please do feedback if encountered any bugs or features that you would like to add.
